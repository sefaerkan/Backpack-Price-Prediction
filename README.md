# Backpack Price Prediction
### Predict the price of backpacks given various attributes.
### Evaluation - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
#### Submissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:
#### $$\textrm{RMSE} =  \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \widehat{y}_i)^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
#### where yË†i is the predicted value and yi is the original value for each instance i.


### Files
#### train.csv - the training dataset; Price is the target
#### train_extra.csv - a lot more training data!
#### test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of Price for each row
#### sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format.
